### Biography
 
| <br>**Jinghua Yang** is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Hong-Ning Dai](https://www.henrylab.net/pubtype/journal/) and [Prof.Chuan Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuan_Chen5)) with the [Faculty of Information Technology], [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/), Macau, China. His research interest includes data mining, image processing, tensor analysis, and deep learning. <br> <br> **Email:** <yangjinghua110@126.com>  &emsp; **Follow me:** [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=&user=Q5D6JL8AAAAJ)  &emsp; [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng_Ding15)  &emsp; [GitHub](https://github.com/MengDing56) <br><br>| &emsp;![image](https://Jinghua-Yang.github.io/images/dingmeng.jpg)&emsp; |

### News
* Dec. 2020: one paper "Hyperspectral Super-Resolution via Interpretable Block-Term Tensor Modeling" has been accepted by _**IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing**_.

* Nov. 2020: Good news, our paper ["Tensor train rank minimization with nonlocal self-similarity for tensor completion"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20Arxiv_Nonlocal_TT_TC.pdf) has been accepted by _**Inverse Problems and Imaging**_.

* June 2020: Check out this submission ["Hyperspectral super-resolution via interpretable block-term tensor modeling"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20Arxiv_SCBTD_HSR.pdf). Here we propose a new tensor-based hyperspectral super-resolution.

* Feb. 2020: We submit ["Tensor train rank minimization with nonlocal self-similarity for tensor completion"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20Arxiv_Nonlocal_TT_TC.pdf). In this work, we propose a new nonlocal tensor train rank-based tensor completion method by exploring the nonlocal self-similarity prior of tensor data.

* Jan. 2020: J-H. Yang, X-L. Zhao, T-H. Ma, **M. Ding**, T-Z. Huang ["Tensor train rank minimization with hybrid smoothness regularization for visual data recovery"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20AMM_JHYang_TT.pdf) has been accepted by _**Applied Mathematical Modelling**_.

* Dec. 2019: **M. Ding**, T-Z. Huang, T-H. Ma, X-L. Zhao, J-H. Yang, ["Cauchy noise removal using group-based low-rank prior"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20AMC_Nonlocal_Cauchy.pdf) has been accepted by _**Applied Mathematics and Computation**_.

* Aug. 2019: **M. Ding**, T-Z. Huang, T-Y. Ji, X-L. Zhao, J-H. Yang, ["Low-Rank Tensor Completion Using Matrix Factorization Based on Tensor Train Rank and Total Variation"](https://MengDing56.gitHub.io/papers/20JSC_MFTTTV_TC.pdf) has been accepted by _**Journal of Scientific Computing**_.
